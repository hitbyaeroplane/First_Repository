There are many answers to the question how would you define video and there is no single correct answer. One of the answers that first come to mind is the the technical definition of video. Still images being played on a screen at a quick rate to simulate motion. This is a very interesting concept but I do not think that this definition is completely correct. The reason for this is that it does not include the creation of video. Incorporating that into the definition would result in a very different definition.

Video is the result of capturing many still images and playing them back at a quick rate for the viewers pleasure.

Overall I believe that that is the correct definition of video.
