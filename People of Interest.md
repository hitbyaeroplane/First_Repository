Since film has such a rich and interessting history there are many very importnat and interesting people. One of these people is EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE.
He is credited with capturing the first video. The reason that he did this was because he was interested in studying motion.
One of the first subjects that he captured was a horse that was running. The result of this was a number of still images of the horse running.
This is the first way video that was ever captured and it led a lot more than a simple horse.
